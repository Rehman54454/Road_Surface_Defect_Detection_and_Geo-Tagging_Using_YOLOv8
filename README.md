# **Description:**
This project demonstrates real-time road surface defect detection and classification using a YOLOv8 model. The detected defects are geo-tagged based on real-time GPS data and visualized on an interactive map using Folium. The system saves defect locations along with their coordinates in a CSV file and generates an HTML map for visualization.
