# **Description:**
This project demonstrates real-time road surface defect detection and classification using a YOLOv8 model. The detected defects are geo-tagged based on real-time GPS data and visualized on an interactive map using Folium. The system saves defect locations along with their coordinates in a CSV file and generates an HTML map for visualization.

# **YOLOv8 Model:**
The YOLOv8 model is a state-of-the-art object detection framework. In this project, a custom-trained YOLOv8 model is used to classify road defects such as:
**Alligator Cracks**
**Edge Cracks**
**Longitudinal Cracks**
**Patching**
**Potholes**
**Rutting**
**Traverse Cracks**
The model achieves high accuracy and precision for real-time road defect detection.

# **Geo-Tagging and Mapping:**
1. **Geo-Tagging:** GPS data (latitude and longitude) is captured and saved in a CSV file alongside defect details.
2. **Interactive Map Visualization:** Detected defects are displayed as markers on a Folium map, color-coded for easy interpretation. The map is saved as an HTML file for offline viewing.

# **OpenCV Integration:**
OpenCV is used for:
1. Reading and processing video frames.
2. Overlaying bounding boxes and labels on detected road defects.
3. Drawing annotation lines and markers for tracking.

# **Sort Tracker:**
The Sort Algorithm is implemented to track detected road defects across frames, ensuring consistent defect identification and geo-tagging.
You can download this sort.py file from [here](https://example.com/dataset)
# **Install Dependencies:**
Install required Python libraries:
pip install ultralytics opencv-python folium pandas numpy tqdm

# **Datasets:**
You can download the dataset used to train the YOLOv8 model from [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/baka-1ravj/road-damage-det)

# **How to Run:**
**Download the YOLOv8 Model Weights:** Download the trained YOLOv8 model weights file Model.pt from [here](https://example.com/dataset)

**Prepare the Input Video:** Replace the video path in the code with the path to your input video file.

**Set Up GPS Input:** Ensure GPS hardware is configured and connected via the serial port.

**Run the Script:** Execute the main Python script: main.py

The system will:
Detect and classify road defects.
Save defect details and geo-coordinates in a CSV file.
Generate an interactive HTML map with defect markers.

# **Example Output:**

**Detected Defects:** Bounding boxes with labels for defects in video frames.

**Geo-Tagged Defects:** An interactive map (defects_map.html) showing the defect locations.

**Saved Data:** CSV file (defect_coordinates.csv) with defect details and geo-coordinates.

# **Example Visualization:**
Interactive Map (Generated by Folium):
